# 🧠 Math & Physics Code Library

A focused collection of clean, well-documented code exploring the foundations of mathematics and physics through direct implementation.

This is not a tutorial repo. It’s a working archive of ideas, simulations, numerical methods, symbolic tools, and computational experiments — built from first principles in **Python** and **C++** and whatever else :).

>>>>> NOTE: README OF THE README. The code here is not meant to replace standard libraries. 99% of the time there is no reason to. The code here is for the 1% of the time you are doing something (really) weird and the 100% of the time 
that you should be learning how things really work. For example something like GCD you can use math.gcd(12, 18) in python etc. Which gets the job done, but if you are wanting to understand say Dedikind and Cauchy then you need 
to understand how these things work.

## 🎯 Purpose

To express core concepts in physics and mathematics through:

- ✳️ Clear, maintainable code — minimal dependencies
- 📐 First-principles derivations and implementations
- ⚙️ Tools and scripts to solve real problems
- 🔬 Numerical and symbolic methods written from scratch
- 💻 CLI-driven utilities

---

## 🔧 Technologies

- **Python** — fast prototyping, clarity, CLI utility
- **C++** — high-performance computation, compiled tools
- Occasionally other appropriate tools
- Fully commented, testable code
- Standalone, Light, fast, dependency-free wherever possible

## 💬 Philosophy

> "If you can't solve it with code, you probably don't understand it."

It's about control, insight, and precision.

MIT. Use it. Learn from it. Fork it. Break it. Just don’t pretend it came from a YouTube short.

Maintained by me - who still believes that the laws of physics matter more than the latest framework.
