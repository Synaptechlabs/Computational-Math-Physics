# 🧠 Math & Physics Code Library

A focused collection of clean, well-documented code exploring the foundations of mathematics and physics through direct implementation.

This is not a tutorial repo. It’s a working archive of ideas, simulations, numerical methods, symbolic tools, and computational experiments — built from first principles in **Python** and **C++** and whatever else :).

>>>>> ### 📌 README of the README

> ⚠️ **NOTE:** The code in this repository is **not** meant to replace standard libraries.  
> In fact, **99% of the time, you shouldn't** — just use `math.gcd()`, `numpy`, `sympy`, etc.

This repo exists for:

- ✅ The **1% of cases** where you're doing something truly weird or low-level.
- ✅ The **100% of the time** where you should **understand how things work under the hood**.

For example, yes, you can write:

```python```
import math
math.gcd(12, 18)

And it gets the job done.

But if you're serious about understanding number theory — or diving deep into Dedekind, Cauchy, Gauss, or even elliptic curves — then it's essential to know the actual algorithms behind it.

This project is for learners, builders, tinkerers, and thinkers who believe that knowing what’s under the hood still matters.

## 🎯 Purpose

To express core concepts in physics and mathematics through:

- ✳️ Clear, maintainable code — minimal dependencies
- 📐 First-principles derivations and implementations
- ⚙️ Tools and scripts to solve real problems
- 🔬 Numerical and symbolic methods written from scratch
- 💻 CLI-driven utilities

---

## 🔧 Technologies

- **Python** — fast prototyping, clarity, CLI utility
- **C++** — high-performance computation, compiled tools
- Occasionally other appropriate tools
- Fully commented, testable code
- Standalone, Light, fast, dependency-free wherever possible

## 💬 Philosophy

> "If you can't solve it with code, you probably don't understand it."

It's about control, insight, and precision.

MIT. Use it. Learn from it. Fork it. Break it. Just don’t pretend it came from a YouTube short.

Maintained by me - who still believes that the laws of physics matter more than the latest framework.
