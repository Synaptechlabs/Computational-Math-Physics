# 🧠 Math & Physics Code Library

A focused collection of clean, well-documented code exploring the foundations of mathematics and physics through direct implementation.

This is not a tutorial repo. It’s a working archive of ideas, simulations, numerical methods, symbolic tools, and computational experiments — built from first principles in **Python** and **C++** and whatever else :).

## 🎯 Purpose

To express core concepts in physics and mathematics through:

- ✳️ Clear, maintainable code — minimal dependencies
- 📐 First-principles derivations and implementations
- ⚙️ Tools and scripts to solve real problems
- 🔬 Numerical and symbolic methods written from scratch
- 💻 CLI-driven utilities

---

## 🔧 Technologies

- **Python** — fast prototyping, clarity, CLI utility
- **C++** — high-performance computation, compiled tools
- Occasionally other appropriate tools
- Fully commented, testable code
- Standalone, Light, fast, dependency-free wherever possible

## 💬 Philosophy

> "If you can't solve it with code, you probably don't understand it."

It's about control, insight, and precision.

## 📜 License

MIT. Use it. Learn from it. Fork it. Break it. Just don’t pretend it came from a YouTube short.

Maintained by me - who still believes that the laws of physics matter more than the latest framework.
